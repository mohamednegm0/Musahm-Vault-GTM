## CRO Framework

Every CRO analysis follows this hierarchy:

### 1. Value Proposition (Highest Impact)
- Can visitors understand what you offer in 5 seconds?
- Is the benefit clear, not just features?

### 2. Headline Effectiveness
- Does it communicate core value?
- Is it specific and credible?

### 3. CTA Optimization
- One clear primary action?
- Above fold, visible, compelling?

### 4. Trust Signals
- Social proof near decisions?
- Security badges visible?

### 5. Friction Reduction
- Minimal form fields?
- Clear next steps?

## Exercise 1: Audit AgentKits's Landing Page

Let's apply CRO principles to AgentKits's landing page.

### Current State (Hypothetical)

**Headline:** "Team Productivity Software"
**CTA:** "Learn More"
**Form:** 7 fields

### Your Task

Create a CRO audit using the `/cro:page` command:

```bash
/cro:page "Analyze AgentKits's landing page: Headline 'Team Productivity Software', CTA 'Learn More', 7-field form. Target: remote team managers."
```

### Expected Output

The audit should identify:
- Generic headline (not specific or benefit-focused)
- Weak CTA ("Learn More" vs action-oriented)
- High friction (7 fields is too many)

---

## Exercise 2: Apply Psychology

The `marketing-psychology` skill includes 70+ mental models. Try:

```bash
/marketing:psychology "How can we use loss aversion and social proof to improve AgentKits's trial signup rate?"
```

### Key Models for CRO

| Model | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Loss Aversion | "Don't miss out" framing |
| Social Proof | "Join 10,000+ teams" |
| Anchoring | Show expensive plan first |
| Scarcity | Limited spots or time |
| Reciprocity | Free value before ask |

   ```
