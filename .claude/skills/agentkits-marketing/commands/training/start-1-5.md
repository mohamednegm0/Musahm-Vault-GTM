The marketing kit includes 6 specialized reviewer agents. These provide expert-level feedback from different perspectives to ensure content quality.

**Duration:** ~30 minutes

### Step 1: Why Reviewer Agents?

Every piece of marketing should be reviewed from multiple angles:
- Brand consistency
- SEO optimization
- Conversion potential
- Persona fit
- Practical implementation

Reviewer agents give you on-demand experts for each area.

### Step 2: The Expert Reviewers

Explain the three expert reviewers:

**`brand-voice-guardian`:**
- Ensures brand voice consistency
- Checks tone and messaging
- Validates against brand guidelines
- Flags off-brand content

**`seo-specialist`:**
- Evaluates keyword usage
- Checks on-page SEO elements
- Reviews content structure
- Identifies optimization opportunities

**`conversion-optimizer`:**
- Assesses CTA effectiveness
- Reviews persuasion elements
- Identifies friction points
- Suggests conversion improvements

### Step 3: The Persona Reviewers

Explain the three persona reviewers:

**`manager-maria` (Marketing Manager, 38yo):**
- B2B mid-size company perspective
- Evaluates team implementation fit
- Considers resource constraints
- Reviews campaign feasibility

**`solo-steve` (Solopreneur, 32yo):**
- One-person business perspective
- Assesses time efficiency
- Reviews self-service ease
- Considers budget sensitivity

**`startup-sam` (Startup Founder, 28yo):**
- Early-stage startup perspective
- Evaluates growth potential
- Reviews virality factors
- Assesses speed to market

### Step 4: Use Expert Reviewers

Practice with expert reviewers:

```
Review our AgentKits blog post with expert reviewers:

1. `brand-voice-guardian`: Evaluate brand consistency
2. `seo-specialist`: Evaluate SEO optimization
3. `conversion-optimizer`: Evaluate conversion potential

Each should score (1-10) and provide:
- Top 3 strengths
- Top 3 improvements needed
- Specific recommended edits
```

### Step 5: Use Persona Reviewers

Practice with persona reviewers:

```
Review our AgentKits email sequence from persona perspectives:

1. `manager-maria`: Would a B2B marketing manager find this valuable?
2. `solo-steve`: Would a solopreneur implement this?
3. `startup-sam`: Would this drive growth for a startup?

Each should evaluate:
- Resonance with their needs
- Implementation feasibility
- Value perception
```

### Step 6: Combined Review Board

Use all reviewers together for comprehensive feedback:

```
Run a full review board on the AgentKits landing page copy:

Expert Reviews:
- Brand consistency (brand-voice-guardian)
- SEO optimization (seo-specialist)
- Conversion potential (conversion-optimizer)

Persona Reviews:
- B2B fit (manager-maria)
- Self-service potential (solo-steve)
- Growth potential (startup-sam)

Synthesize: What changes would satisfy all reviewers?
```

### Step 7: Iterative Improvement

Show the review-improve cycle:

```
1. Create content
2. Get multi-reviewer feedback
3. Implement top priority changes
4. Re-review changed content
5. Repeat until all reviewers score 8+
```

### Step 8: When to Use Which Reviewer

Provide guidance:

| Content Type | Primary Reviewers |

| Landing pages | conversion-optimizer, manager-maria |
