### Lesson Overview

**Module 2.3: Generate Marketing Copy**

Learn to create professional marketing copy at scale: emails, ads, social, landing pages. Quality + Speed.

**Duration:** ~35 minutes

---

### Step 1: Email Welcome Sequence

Use the sequence command:

```
/sequence:welcome "AgentKits" "trial users - remote team managers"
```

Review the generated sequence:
- Email 1 (Day 0): Welcome + Quick Start
- Email 2 (Day 2): Feature Highlight
- Email 3 (Day 5): Social Proof + Tips
- Email 4 (Day 9): Value Reinforcement
- Email 5 (Day 13): Trial Ending + Upgrade

Each email includes:
- Subject line variations for A/B testing
- Preview text
- Body copy
- Clear CTA

### Step 2: Social Media Content

Use content commands for social:

**LinkedIn:**
```
/content:social "Team coordination tips for remote managers - AgentKits launch" "linkedin"
```

**Twitter:**
```
/content:social "5 ways remote teams waste time coordinating - thread" "twitter"
```

### Step 3: Blog Content

Use blog command with SEO focus:

```
/content:blog "How Remote Teams Can Coordinate Focus Time Without Endless Meetings" "remote team focus time"
```

Then optimize:
```
/seo:optimize "the blog post" "remote team focus time"
```

### Step 4: Paid Ad Copy

Use ad copy commands:

**Google Ads:**
```
/content:ads "google" "team productivity software - drive signups"
```

**Meta Ads:**
```
/content:ads "meta" "remote team coordination - awareness campaign"
```

**LinkedIn Ads:**
```
/content:ads "linkedin" "B2B productivity tool - lead generation"
```

### Step 5: Landing Page Copy

Use landing page command:

```
/content:landing "14-day free trial of AgentKits" "remote team managers at tech companies"
```

This generates:
- Hero section (headline, subhead, CTA)
- Problem section
- Solution section
- Features with benefits
- Social proof section
- Pricing overview
- FAQ section
- Final CTA

### Step 6: Fast vs Good Content

Explain the two content modes:

**Fast Content (`/content:fast`):**
- Quick turnaround
- Good for ideation
- First drafts
- High volume needs

```
/content:fast "Quick LinkedIn post about team focus time benefits"
```

**Good Content (`/content:good`):**
- Thorough research
- Multiple variations
- Publication-ready
- Strategic pieces

```
/content:good "Detailed blog post about the science of team focus time with research citations"
```

### Step 7: Content Enhancement

Use enhancement commands:

```
/content:enhance "make the copy more conversational and add urgency"
```

```
/content:cro "optimize for higher conversion rate"
```

### Step 8: A/B Test Variations

Create test variations:

```
Create A/B test variations for the landing page:

Headlines (5 angles):
1. Outcome-focused
2. Problem-focused
3. Question
4. How-to
5. Social proof

CTAs (3 variations):
1. Start Free Trial
2. Try It Free
3. Get Started Now
```

### Step 9: Personalization by Persona

Create persona-specific variations:

**For Solo Sam:**
```
/content:email "product announcement" "technical team managers - efficiency focus"
```

**For Startup Sam:**
```
/content:email "product announcement" "startup founders - growth and scale focus"
```

### Step 10: Quality Review

Review all content with specialists:

```
Review all content we created with:
1. brand-voice-guardian - brand consistency
2. conversion-optimizer - conversion potential
3. seo-specialist - SEO optimization

Score each piece and identify top improvements needed.
```
