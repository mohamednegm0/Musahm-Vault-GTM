## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure you have:
- [ ] Task or request clearly defined
- [ ] Keywords or intent understood

## Context Loading

Load these files first:
1. `.claude/skills/skills-registry.json` - Skills catalog
2. `.claude/skills/dependency-graph.md` - Skill dependencies

# Skill Selector

You are an intelligent skill selection system. Your job is to analyze user requests and recommend the most relevant skills from the skills registry.

## How It Works

1. **Parse Intent** - Extract keywords and intent from the user's request
2. **Match Skills** - Search `skills-registry.json` for matching triggers
3. **Load Dependencies** - Check prerequisite skills in dependency graph
4. **Rank Results** - Score and prioritize skills by relevance
5. **Recommend** - Return top 3-5 skills with rationale

## Selection Algorithm

### Step 1: Read the Registry
```
Read: .claude/skills/skills-registry.json
```

### Step 2: Extract Keywords
From the user's request, identify:
- Action words (optimize, create, write, analyze, improve)
- Domain words (CRO, SEO, email, content, pricing)
- Specific terms (landing page, form, popup, sequence)
- Goal words (conversions, traffic, leads, revenue)

### Step 3: Match Against Triggers
For each skill in the registry:
- Check if any trigger keywords match user's keywords
- Calculate match score based on:
  - Exact matches (weight: 1.0)
  - Partial matches (weight: 0.5)
  - Category matches (weight: 0.3)

### Step 4: Load Prerequisites
For matched skills:
- Check `dependencyGraph` for prerequisites
- Load prerequisites first (depth-first)
- Maintain loading order: Foundation → Specialized

### Step 5: Limit Context
- Maximum 5 skills to avoid context overload
- Prioritize: Direct matches > Prerequisites > Related
- Consider difficulty progression

## Output Format

## Examples

### Example 1: CRO Request
**User:** "Optimize our signup form for more conversions"

**Analysis:**
- Keywords: optimize, signup, form, conversions
- Matches: signup-flow-cro (0.9), form-cro (0.8), page-cro (0.6)
- Prerequisites: form-cro requires page-cro

**Result:**
1. page-cro (foundation)
2. form-cro (prerequisite)
3. signup-flow-cro (primary match)

### Example 2: Content Request
**User:** "Write landing page copy"

**Analysis:**
- Keywords: write, landing page, copy
- Matches: copywriting (0.9), page-cro (0.6)

**Result:**
1. copywriting (primary match)
2. page-cro (related context)

### Example 3: Growth Request
**User:** "Plan our Product Hunt launch"

**Analysis:**
- Keywords: plan, Product Hunt, launch
- Matches: launch-strategy (0.95)
- Prerequisites: content-strategy, social-media

**Result:**
1. content-strategy (prerequisite)
2. social-media (prerequisite)
3. launch-strategy (primary match)

## Special Cases

### Ambiguous Requests
If the request could match multiple unrelated skills:
- Ask clarifying question
- List top options with explanations
- Let user choose

### No Clear Matches
If no skills match well:
- Suggest closest alternatives
- Recommend foundation skills
- Ask for more context

### Complex Multi-Skill Requests
If request spans multiple domains:
- Identify primary goal
- Load foundation skills first
- Suggest phased approach

## Invoke Skills

After selection, activate skills by reading their SKILL.md files:
```
Read: .claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md
```

For skills with references:
```
Read: .claude/skills/[skill-name]/references/[topic].md
```
